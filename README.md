Project Description

I decided to open a small caf√© in Moscow. It is original - the guests are to be served by robots. The project has a lot of promise, but it is expensive. Together with my partners I decide to approach investors. They are interested in the current state of the market - will I be able to win popularity for a long time, when all the onlookers are looking at the robot waiters?

My goals to find:

1. Which type of catering facility is characterized by network distribution?

2. What is characteristic of a chain establishment: many establishments with a small number of seats each or few establishments with a large number of seats?

3. For each type of food service facility, describe the average number of seats. Which type provides, on average, the largest number of seats?

4. Separate the street information from the address column into a separate column.

5. Construct a graph of the top 10 streets by number of food service facilities. Use external information and answer the question - in which districts of Moscow are these streets?

6. Find the number of streets with one catering facility. Use external information and answer the question - in which districts of Moscow are these streets?
